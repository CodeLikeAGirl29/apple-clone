A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

__Layout summary__

The page is divided into four parts - 
1. A header with a navigation bar.
2. A hero featuring the iPhone 13Pro with an image.
3. A sub hero containing 4 images for different products, and a recall program link.
4. A footer with site links and legal links.

---

The __navigation bar__ has a full width black background, but the content is centred. You can define a container class with a max-width px value and margin: 0 auto; to achieve this. The links are evenly spread across, there are 10 links, so each link should take up 10% width.

The **hero** has some centred text, and an iphone image. The simplest way to add the iphone image is by adding a <div> with a height value (600px), then add the image as a CSS background-image on the <div>.

The **sub hero** has 4 images evenly distributed across. Each one should take up 25% width. Easiest way is to use <div> and set CSS background-image on each of the <div>. The recall link is simply a centred <a>, you can nest it in a <div> then add text align the <div>

The **footer** has 5 columns of site links. Each column should take up 20% width. The easiest way to do this is simply use <div> elements for each column and set them to inline-block, then set width to 20%.
